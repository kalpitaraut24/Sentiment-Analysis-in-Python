    "\n",
    "Ans: I use the VADER SENTIMENT analysis tool. Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner(VADER) is a lexicon and rule based sentiment analysis tool that is specifically attenuated to sentiments expressed in social media. The lexicon based approach involves calculating orientation for a document from the semantic orientation (positive, negative or neutral) of words and phrases in the document. VADER has been found to be quite successful when dealing with social media texts, NY Times editorials, movie reviews, and product reviews. This is because VADER not only tells about the Positivity and Negativity score but also tells us about how positive or negative a sentiment is.\n",

    "Ans: The compound score is a metric that is sued to denote whether a text is positive, negative or neutral. It does so by summing the valence scores of each word in the lexicon, adjusted according to the rules, and then normalized to be between -1 (most extreme negative) and +1 (most extreme positive). Typical threshold values (used in the literature cited on this page) are:\n",

Although there were certain cases in the results where the tool computed the analysis to be negative because of the use of certain words like 'crazy'. In context with this particuar conversation, the word 'crazy' was used to signify the magnitude of something. However, the lexcion value computed the sentiment as negative. Another case was when the tool computed the analysis as positive instead of negative. Phrases like 'I have to go', 'I'll talk to you later' more often than not denote disinterest in continuing the conversation. With respect to this conversation, the user didn't respond to the previous text that was a rhetorical question and decided to leave the conversation all of a sudden.
